## Stack-Machine

A stack machine is a kind of automaton that uses a stack for auxiliary data storage. The size of the stack  is  unbounded—it  never  runs  out  of  space—and  that  gives  stack machines  an  edge  over  fi nite  automata.  In  effect,  stack  machines  have infinite memory, though they must use it in stack order.
A stack machine M is a 4-tuple M = (*, 6, S, G), where* is the stack alphabet6 is the input alphabetS* is the initial stack symbolG ((6 {ε}) u*oP(**)) is the transition function
